## Challenge: Numbers - Incrementor & Decrementor

### Incrementor / Decrementor

As programmers, we are constantly updating data. By now you're probably getting pretty familiar with how to reassign the value of a variable, but here's an example to refresh your memory.

```js
let num = 7;

num = num + 1;
console.log(num); // => 8
```

Notice how we use the syntax `num = num + 1` to change the value of num. Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to type our variable name in twice? Luckily, in JavaScript, we have some really useful built-in operators to help us handle this redundancy. The first 2 we are going to cover are the incrementor (`++`) and the decrementor (`--`). Take a look at the example below:

```js
let num = 10;

num++
console.log(num) // => 11
```

In the above example, just by using `num++` we were able to increment the value of `num` by 1. Likewise, if we wanted to decrement the value by one, we could use `num--`. These operators are extremely useful, and you'll be using them quite a lot in Precourse - Part 2 when we dive into loops.

### Challenge

1. Using the `incrementor` operator, increase the value of `num1` by 1.

2. Using the `decrementor` operator, decrease the value of `num2` by 1.
