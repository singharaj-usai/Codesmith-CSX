## Challenge: Numbers - Assignment Operators

### Assignment Operator

What if we wanted to increase our value by more than 1 though? Luckily, there's an operator for that as well! We call this an assignment operator.

```js
let num = 5;

num += 10
console.log(num) // => 15
```

Here, we have the syntax of `num += 10`. This is the same thing as typing `num = num + 10`. By using the addition assignment operator (`+=`) we are able to add 10 to `num` similarly to how we did above with the incrementor/decrementor.

The best part, is we aren't just limited to addition with the assignment operator. Each arithmetic operator has its own assignment operator:

`+=` - addition

`-=` - subtraction

`*=` - multiplication

`/=` - division

### Challenge

1. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of `num1` to the current value plus 17.

2. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of `num2` to the current value minus 14.

3. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of `num3` to the current value times 11.

4. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of `num4` to the current value divided by 8.

Utilize the `console` to test your code before you submit it!
