## Comments and the Console

Welcome to your first challenge! Don't worry, we'll ease you into it. We're going to go step by step through the basics throughout this entire pre-course unit. Don't stress out too much if it seems a little daunting at first.

You'll be using the code editor to the right to work through the challenges provided while viewing the output of your code in the `console` window just below it.

Unfortunately, much of what the computer does "under the hood" is invisible to us. This is where the console comes in! If we want the computer to show us what's going on, we can print, or log, directly to our console.

Logging things to the console is a really handy way to see how JavaScript is interpreting values. We'll be using it frequently throughout the course, so you'll be a pro at it in no time. To use it, you need only type `console.log()` - whatever you pass between the parentheses (`()`) will be logged to the console.

Notice that there are two forward slashes (`//`) before the `console.log` statement on line 2. These forward slashes create a `comment`. Comments are another really useful tool because they let us write little notes for ourselves or anyone else who's reading our code. Commented lines are ignored when the code runs, so they won't affect what happens when our code runs.

Go ahead and run the code in the editor to the right by clicking the blue "Run Code" button. Nothing got printed to the console! The only thing we see is the console's note to us that it has finished executing code. How can we fix this?

Let's give it a try, you got it! Then uncomment the console.log statement on line 2 by removing the forward slashes (//) at the beginning of the line. Now let's run the code again by clicking the blue Run Code button again. Now you should see "Hello World!" down in your console window.

Challenge
Now it's your turn! Go ahead and give it a try yourself! Create your own console.log below line 4. You can print any word or phrase you like to the console. Just make sure you put the word or phrase in between quotes ("") like the example. We'll go into detail very soon as to what that means.


Reminder: If you have a question - ask it to a mentor on the CSX Slack in the #csx-challenge-help channel.

We donâ€™t provide solutions to all problems on CSX; we feel the best way to learn a new skill is by persevering through the "hard learning." However, we are always available to discuss best practices and talk through your solution if you reach out to a CSX Mentor through our CSX Slack channel.
