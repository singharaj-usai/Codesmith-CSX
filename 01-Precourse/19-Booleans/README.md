## Challenge: Booleans

Boolean (BOO-lee-uhn) is another data type in JavaScript. JavaScript boolean values can be either `true` or `false`. They are useful for determining whether or not blocks of code should be executed. They are also the default result for many evaluations.

```js
let likesJavaScript = true;
let likesMath = false;

const numToCheck = 10;
console.log(numToCheck === 10) // => true
```

In the example above, we're using the `===` operator (we'll talk about this in more detail in the next challenge) to compare `numToCheck` with 10 and determine if they are equal. If they are equal, both in value and data type, then JavaScript will log `true`. Otherwise, it will log `false`.

Booleans are extremely handy when dealing with conditional statements - you'll learn more about them in a later section.

### Challenge

1. Below line 3, reassign the value of `iHaveChanged` to `true`.

2. Declare a variable `iLoveCoding` and assign it a boolean value of `true`.

3. Declare a variable `codingIsTooHard` and assign it the boolean value of `false`.
