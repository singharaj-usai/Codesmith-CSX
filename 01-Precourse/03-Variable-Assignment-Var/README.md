## Challenge: Variable Assignment - (var)

**Challenge**

Now that we know what variables are, let's create one of our own. Below line 6, declare a variable named `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name. Make sure you wrap your name in quotation marks, e.g. `"Smith"`. Here's another example in case:

```js
var myName = "Kyle";
console.log(myName) // => "Kyle"
```

Now, go back to line 1 and modify the value of `firstName` to be your first name. Uncomment the console.log statement on line 10 and run your code; you should see Jenny replaced by your first name—unless your first name is Jenny, of course.
