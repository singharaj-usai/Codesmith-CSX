## Challenge: typeof Operator

Quite often in programming, we need to be able to look up what the specific data type of a given operand is. In JavaScript, the `typeof` operator returns the data type of its operand in the form of a string. Operand can be any object, function or variable.

```js
typeof("testing")   // => "string"
typeof(22)         // => "number"
typeof(false)      // => "boolean"
```

Keep in mind that the `typeof` an array is an object.

### Challenge

1. Declare a variable `favMovieType`. Then, using the typeof operator, assign it the value of `favMovie`'s data type.

2. Declare a variable `timesSeenType`. Then, using the typeof operator, assign it the value of `timesSeen`'s data type.

3. Declare a variable `seeAgainType`. Then, using the typeof operator, assign it the value of `goingToWatchItAgain`'s data type.
