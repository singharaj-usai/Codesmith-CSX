## Challenge: Loops - Multiple Conditions

Write a function `addingAllTheWeirdStuff` which adds the sum of all the odd numbers in `array2` to each element under 10 in `array1`. Similarly, `addingAllTheWeirdStuff` should also add the sum of all the even numbers in `array2` to those elements over 10 in `array1`.

BONUS: If any element in `array2` is greater than 20, add 1 to every element in `array1`.
