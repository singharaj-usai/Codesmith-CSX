## Challenge: Loops & Control Flow

Write a function `mergingTripletsAndQuints` which takes in two arrays as arguments. This function will return a new array replacing the elements in `array1` if they are divisible by 3 or 5. The number should be replaced with the sum of itself added to the element at the corresponding index in `array2`.
