## Challenge: wereAwesome

Write a function `wereAwesome` that takes you and your pair programming partner's name and returns the string "[your buddy's name] and [you] are awesome!"

If you are coding on your own, get creative! Instead of a pair programming partner, it could be the name of your friend, your pet, or even your rubber ducky!
