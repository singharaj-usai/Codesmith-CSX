## Challenge: While Loops - Counters

Using a WHILE loop, write a function `imAboutToExplodeWithExcitement` which prints a countdown from `n`. When the countdown gets to `5`, print `'Oh wow, I can't handle the anticipation!'` When it's at `3`, print `'I'm about to explode with excitement!'` When the counter is finished, print `'That was kind of a let down'`.
