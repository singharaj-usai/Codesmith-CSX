## Challenge: Control Flow - if statements and the Math object

Using an IF/ELSE statement, write a function `closestToTheMark` that takes two player inputs as number arguments. The function will return 'Player 1 is closest' or 'Player 2 is closest' depending on which player input is closest to the randomly generated number.

Note: Due to the output being based off of a random factor, the tests provided below cannot determine if you have solved the prompt exactly. The test cases for this challenge check for the correct data types only.
