## Challenge: Objects - Adding Properties

You are provided with an array, `possibleIterable`. Using a for loop, build out the object `divByThree` so that each key is an element of `possibleIterable` that is divisible by three. The value of each key should be the array index at which that key can be found in `possibleIterable`.
