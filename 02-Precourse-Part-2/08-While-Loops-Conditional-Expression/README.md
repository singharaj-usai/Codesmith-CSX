## Challenge: While Loops - Conditional Expression

Initialize a variable `addThis` to 0 and a variable `sum` to 0. Use a while loop to repeat a code block as long as `addThis` is less than 10. In the code block, add the value of `addThis` to `sum`, then increment `addThis` by 1. After the while loop runs, the value of sum should be the sum of the numbers 0 through 9. It's crucial to note that if there's more than one statement in the loop block, the entire block needs to be enclosed in curly braces `{}`. This ensures that all statements within the block are executed together in each iteration of the loop.
