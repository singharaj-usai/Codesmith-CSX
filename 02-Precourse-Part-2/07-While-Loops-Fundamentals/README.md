## Challenge: While Loops - Fundamentals

A while loop is an alternative iteration statement. JavaScript's thread of execution will repeatedly process the code block until the while loop's conditional expression evaluates to false. **Be careful to avoid an infinite loop!**

### Challenge

Use a while loop to increment `count` by 2 on each repetition of the block of code. Run the code block of your while loop until count is 8.
