## Challenge: Objects - Evaluating Keys

You are given an object called `sumMe` containing several key/value pairs and a variable called `total` whose initial value is 0. Using a `for... in loop`, iterate through the keys of sumMe; if the value corresponding to a key is a number, add it to `total`.
