## Challenge: Objects - Examining Properties

Objects are data structures used to store related data represented with `keys` and associated `values`. Keys are also referred to as `properties`. Keys give us an easy way to reference the values, so they are almost always descriptive strings. Values can be any valid data type: a number, string, array, even other objects that contain even more objects!

We can iterate through an object's properties in much the same way we iterate through the elements of an array, though the implementation is a bit different. Research `for... in` and `Object.keys` before continuing with these challenges.

### Challenge

You are provided with an object called `checkObj`. Using a `for... in` loop, determine if the object contains the property `foundNum`. If it exists, reassign the value of `found` to 1.
