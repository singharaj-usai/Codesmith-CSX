## Challenge: fizzbuzz

Use a loop to iterate through the numbers 1 through 16. Push each number into `fb`, but push the string "fizz" in place of numbers divisible by 3, "buzz" in place of numbers divisible by 5, and "fizzbuzz" in place of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

Log `fb` to the console to see the output.

**Hint**: Check out the remainder/modulo operator: `%`.
